If you want to run the project locally, you need to serve the code from a web server
and access it on localhost.

If you have a NodeJS setup, you can use [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server).

Just run
```
npm install http-server -g
```

then on your terminal
```
http-server C:\location\to\app
```
